# Mirage3D

Welcome to Mirage3D, an open-source repository dedicated to text-to-3D and image-to-3D conversions. Our implementations, derived from various other open-source projects, are optimized to output GLB files, making it easier for you to integrate 3D models into your projects.

## Features

- Text-to-3D: Convert plain text into 3D models.
- Image-to-3D: Transform 2D images into 3D models.

## Source Repositories

Our implementations are based on the following open-source repositories:

- [ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion](https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion)
- [openai/point-e](https://github.com/openai/point-e)
- [openai/shap-e](https://github.com/openai/shap-e)


We are grateful to the original authors for their work.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the desired script (text-to-3D or image-to-3D).
3. Input your text or image.
4. The script will output a GLB file.
